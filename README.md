# Around The U.S.

### A webpage using CSS, and HTML with the BEM methodology and Javascript

I have built this webpage using flexbox and grid. The webpage is about a trip around the US. 
I have made a responsive web design and it should look good on all of the most popular screen sizes, therefor I used media queries. For texts I used "Inter" font family. The CSS classes and files were organized according to the BEM methodology. 
On top of that, I used functions in javascript in order to make the webpage interactive, and to be able to make changes inside it. In this case, I added an option to edit the name and description on the profile part. 

## Future steps
* Add different fonts in order to make the web page a more personal touch.
* Add images from further places in the usa, intercatively, by the "add" button. 
* Add some more buttons in order to be able to edit further parts of the webpage, such as logos, etc...
