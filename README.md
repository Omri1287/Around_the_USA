# Around The U.S.

### A webpage using CSS, and HTML with the BEM methodology and Javascript

I have built this webpage using flexbox and grid. The webpage is about a trip around the US. 
I have made a responsive web design and it should look good on all of the most popular screen sizes, therefor I used media queries. For texts I used "Inter" font family. The CSS classes and files were organized according to the BEM methodology. 
On top of that, I used functions in javascript in order to make the webpage interactive, and to be able to make changes inside it. In this case, I added an option to edit the name and description on the profile part. 
The webpage also consists modular JS, and contains script files dedicated for classes.  

## JS features
* The option to edit the profile in the page, and change the name and dscription
* Add button which is adding selected images
* Enabling to enlarge the images once clicked on
* "like button" for each image
* "delete button" for each image
* An option to close the popups by clicking anywhere outside the modal itself plus by pressing esc
* Validating the forms, and restricting the info type inserted in the required fields. 

## Future steps
* Add different fonts in order to make the web page a more personal touch.
* Adding a form which enables to selected the most highly liked image of all the gallery.
* Add some more buttons in order to be able to edit further parts of the webpage, such as logos and videos.
